### Feature Engineering
**Encoding:**

1. [Visiting: Categorical Features and Encoding in Decision Trees.](https://medium.com/data-design/visiting-categorical-features-and-encoding-in-decision-trees-53400fa65931)
It compares 4 different encoding (Categorical, numeric, One-Hot, Binary) in Decision Tree. Plots are very interesting. Conclusion: 1. Don't use One-Hot Encoding. 2. Categorical features with large cardinalities (over 1000): Binary. 3. Categorical features with small cardinalities (less than 1000): Numeric.
