- {quote: '<p>In this project, we use <strong> Gaussian Hidden Markov Model</strong>
  to catch the stock price pattern and forecast the stock price of seven high-tech companies,
  and compared it to traditional time series models. Instead of assuming independent
  observation, we consider Hidden Markov Model with correlated observations,
  by adding closing price difference. The four latent statuses in our HMM models can
  basically catch the increasing and decreasing pattern, and under some simple
  investment strategy, HMM model has a more stable and better pay-offs than
  traditional time series models.</p>',

 Other moments of note were collecting the largest number of paperclips in the
 office, and winning a trophy for saying "uh huh, and then what?" 30 times in a
 row to my girlfriend without her noticing.</p>',
